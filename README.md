This library contains a collection of useful C++ tools and objects
that work together with the `deal.II` library (www.dealii.org)
developed by me and some of my students in the last ten years.  In
this library I collect all the developed tools which were not subject
to licence restrictions. If you find this collection useful, feel free
to download, use it and suggest pull requests!

The official distribution is on GitHub, and you can clone the
repository using

	git clone https://github.com/luca-heltai/dealii-sak.git

This file is subject to LGPL version 2.1 or later and may not be
distributed without copyright and license information. Please refer to
section 5 and 6 of this file for further information on this license.

1. Deal.II Requirements:
========================

The distributed source code requires the deal.II 8.3 library or
greater. It is used regularly with the development release of deal.II.

2. Installation procedure:
==========================

Clone the Swiss Army Knife using 

	git clone https://github.com/luca-heltai/dealii-sak.git

The library can then be compiled by running

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake -DDEAL_II_DIR=/path/to/deal.II ..
	make

and tested using 
    
	make test

You can modify the resulting `CMakeCache.txt` to set a different 
installation path, or you can call cmake with the additional
option `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir`.
Corresponding environment variable should be included `DEAL_II_SAK=/path/to/install/dir`.  
	
3. Extensive documentation:
===========================

If the user has the program Doxygen installed, a complete and
browsable documentation of the source code itself can be generated by
making the `docs` target (only available if Doxygen was found):

	make docs

In this case, the documentation will be accessible in the subdirectory

	./doc/html

If the user wants the deal.II documentation to be inlined, then the
file http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.tag should be
downloaded to the building directory before making the documentation,
for example, usgin wget

	wget http://www.dealii.org/developer/doxygen/deal.tag
	make docs

5. Licence Informations
